# Programming in Python I

## Goals
123
Python (www.python.org) is one of the most commonly used Programming languages in machine learning and AI.
It is a powerful and versatile programming language that allows for fast prototyping in simple scripts up to complex software development.
These materials shall provide an introduction to programming and Python with a focus on Machine Learning.

## Usage
- First complete the materials in the "slides" folder and then start with the materials in the "code" folder.
- After each unit, try to complete the tasks and check the solutions. The first 2 digits of the filenames indicate the Unit. Slides and code are separated and do not share Units.
- A good setup is important. The first units will show you how to install Python 3.6 and PyCharm.
- For the Units with Python code, step through the code in the PyCharm debugger and check the variable values (variable explorer) after each statement. Feel free to play around with the code.
